# Node-Python communication
# Ting Yew, Davis

Cloned boilerplate from [here](https://github.com/navjotts/node-python/tree/example_ml_image_classification.), by **navjotts**. 

A concise explanation on how the underlying systems work (interaction between node and python) is given [here](https://mc.ai/deploying-a-deep-learning-image-classification-model-with-fastai-python-and-nodejs/).

# Original README.md

Starter code to use nodejs with a python layer as the backend

(useful for deploying Machine Learning models if you want to use nodejs as your web framework)

### Setup
(in the root folder)
```
$ npm install
